    <p>Awardee </p>
    <p>Chosen as a recipient of the Tanoto Foundation Scholarship, a competitive leadership-based scholarship that supports academic excellence and social impact. Through this program, I developed greater self-awareness, practiced collaborative leadership, and built a valuable networking  across Indonesia â€” all of which have contributed significantly to strengthening my soft skills.</p>
